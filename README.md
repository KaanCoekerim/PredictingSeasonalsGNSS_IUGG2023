## Introduction
Seasonal oscillations in GNSS time series are a major source of noise for the interpretation of tectonic signals and are difficult to remove with established methods such as regression models, especially with regards to inter-annual wavelength variations of the seasonal signal. Non-tidal fluid loading is shown to be a main cause of the seasonality in tectonic geodesy, though the exact interactions remain to be determined.

Here, we show the capabilities in predicting and removing the seasonal signals by using global non-tidal fluid data and attempt to shed some light into the interaction between non-tidal fluid loading and seasonal noise of GNSS time series.
